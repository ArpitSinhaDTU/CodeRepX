successors = node.successors
if successors is not None:
    new_nodes = [n for n in successors if n not in nodesseen]
    queue.extend(new_nodes)
    nodesseen.update(new_nodes)

This way, if successors is None, it doesn't try to process it, preventing the TypeError.

I should also make sure that the rest of the code remains the same. The queue is correctly initialized, and nodesseen is a set that's being updated properly. The loop continues until the queue is empty, which is correct for BFS.

So, the final code should include this check to handle the case where node.successors returns None.
